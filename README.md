I'm currently working on implementing a chatbot through Microsoft Azure's OpenAI integreation. The chatbot parses through my resume and uses it to answer questions in a chatbox. This has been great experince handling API requests. Currently the chatbot works locally and I am working to get it working on the live deployment.
